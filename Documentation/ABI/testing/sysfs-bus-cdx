What:		/sys/bus/cdx/rescan
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file will cause rescan of the bus
		and devices on the CDX bus. Any new devices are scanned and
		added to the list of Linux devices and any devices removed are
		also deleted from Linux.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/rescan

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/enable
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing bus number in hex to this file will attempt to enable
		the CDX bus. The bus number for the cdx devices can be found
		at /sys/bus/cdx/devices/cdx-BB:DD, where BB denotes the bus
		number for the respective device.

		For example ::

		  # echo 00 > /sys/bus/cdx/enable

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/disable
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing bus number in hex to this file will attempt to disable
		the CDX bus. CDX bus should be disabled before updating the
		devices in FPGA. The bus number for the cdx devices can be
		found at /sys/bus/cdx/devices/cdx-BB:DD, where BB denotes the
		bus number for the respective device.

		For example ::

		  # echo 00 > /sys/bus/cdx/disable

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../vendor
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Vendor ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal. Vendor ID is
		16 bit identifier which is specific to the device manufacturer.
		Combination of Vendor ID and Device ID identifies a device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../device
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Device ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal. Device ID is
		16 bit identifier to identify a device type within the range
		of a device manufacturer.
		Combination of Vendor ID and Device ID identifies a device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../reset
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file resets the CDX device.
		On resetting the device, the corresponding driver is notified
		twice, once before the device is being reset, and again after
		the reset has been complete.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/.../reset

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../remove
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	tarak.reddy@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file removes the corresponding
		device from the CDX bus. If the device is to be reconfigured
		reconfigured in the Hardware, the device can be removed, so
		that the device driver does not access the device while it is
		being reconfigured.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../remove
